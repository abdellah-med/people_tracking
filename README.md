This project implements real-time object tracking using YOLO (You Only Look Once) on a video file or webcam feed. The system detects and tracks people in the video, displaying bounding boxes in red along with their unique tracking IDs. It also provides real-time mouse position feedback on the video frame. The project utilizes OpenCV, YOLO, and cvzone to process frames continuously and visualize detections.
